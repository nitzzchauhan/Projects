Here are 50 Python OOP coding questions that focus on various OOP concepts and applications, ranging from basic to advanced topics.

### Class and Object Basics:

1. **Create a class `Car` with attributes `brand`, `model`, and `year`. Initialize these attributes using the constructor.**
   
2. **Create a method inside the `Car` class that prints the car details in a formatted string.**

3. **Write a Python program to create multiple objects of the `Car` class and print their details.**

4. **Define a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Add a method `greet()` that prints `"Hello, my name is <name> and I am <age> years old"`.**

5. **Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Add methods to calculate the area and perimeter.**

6. **Write a Python program to create two objects of `Rectangle` and compare their areas.**

7. **Create a class `Student` with attributes `name`, `marks`, and `grade`. Add a method to calculate the grade based on marks.**

8. **Write a Python program to create a `BankAccount` class with methods to deposit and withdraw money, and to check the balance.**

9. **Create a class `Circle` with an attribute `radius`. Add a method to calculate and return the area of the circle.**

10. **Create a class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `salary`, and `department`. Add a method `display_employee()` to print employee details.**

### Constructors and Destructors:

11. **Create a class `Book` with a constructor that accepts `title`, `author`, and `price`. Add a method to display the book details.**

12. **Write a Python program that demonstrates the use of the destructor method `__del__` by printing a message when an object is destroyed.**

13. **Create a class `Person` that accepts `name` and `age` as input. Implement a destructor that prints `"Object destroyed"` when the object is deleted.**

14. **Create a class `Calculator` with methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use the constructor to initialize two numbers.**

15. **Implement a class `Student` with a constructor that accepts `name` and a list of marks. Add a method to calculate the average marks of the student.**

### Encapsulation:

16. **Create a class `Laptop` with private attributes `brand`, `model`, and `price`. Add getter and setter methods for these attributes.**

17. **Write a Python program to implement a `BankAccount` class with private attributes `balance` and `account_number`. Use getter and setter methods to access and modify the balance.**

18. **Define a class `Employee` with private attributes `name`, `salary`, and `age`. Add methods to modify and retrieve the salary.**

19. **Create a class `User` with a private attribute `password`. Add methods to validate and change the password only if the old password matches.**

20. **Write a Python program that uses encapsulation to prevent direct access to the data of a `Person` class, but allows it through getter and setter methods.**

### Inheritance:

21. **Create a class `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Create two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal` and override the `speak()` method.**

22. **Write a Python program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance using three classes: `Grandparent`, `Parent`, and `Child`. Each class should have a method that prints a message.**

23. **Create a class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Inherit this class in a subclass `Car` and add an attribute `doors`. Add methods to display details of the car.**

24. **Write a Python program to demonstrate multiple inheritance using two base classes `Person` and `Employee`, and a derived class `Manager`.**

25. **Create a class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Inherit this class in `Circle` and `Square` classes, and override the `area()` method in both.**

26. **Create a class `Employee` with a method `work()`. Create a subclass `Manager` that overrides `work()` to add more responsibilities.**

27. **Implement a program where `Teacher` is a subclass of `Person`, and it adds a new method `teach()`.**

28. **Write a Python program to create a base class `Animal` with a method `move()`. Derive `Bird` and `Fish` classes and override the `move()` method with specific implementations.**

29. **Create a class `Phone` with a method `call()`. Inherit it in `Smartphone` and add new methods like `browse()` and `play_music()`.**

30. **Create a program that demonstrates hierarchical inheritance, where a base class `Vehicle` is inherited by `Bike` and `Car`. Each subclass should add its specific methods.**

### Polymorphism and Method Overriding:

31. **Write a Python program that demonstrates method overriding using a base class `Shape` and two derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.**

32. **Create two classes `Dog` and `Cat` with a method `sound()`. Use polymorphism to call the `sound()` method of both classes.**

33. **Write a program that demonstrates method overloading by defining a `Calculator` class where the `add()` method works for both two and three parameters.**

34. **Implement a program to demonstrate polymorphism by creating a list of objects of different classes and calling their methods in a loop.**

35. **Create a `Vehicle` class with a method `start()`. Create two subclasses `Car` and `Bike`, each overriding the `start()` method with a different message.**

36. **Write a Python program that uses a common interface method `play_sound()` for classes `Guitar` and `Piano` to demonstrate polymorphism.**

37. **Create a class `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Then, create subclasses `Cow`, `Dog`, and `Duck` that override the `speak()` method.**

38. **Write a Python program to demonstrate polymorphism using a `move()` method in a `Bird` and `Fish` class.**

39. **Create a base class `Device` with a method `turn_on()`. Subclass `Laptop` and `Phone` from `Device` and override `turn_on()` for both.**

40. **Write a Python program to demonstrate operator overloading by creating a class `ComplexNumber` that supports adding two complex numbers using `__add__()`.**

### Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

41. **Write a Python program to define an abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `move()`. Implement subclasses `Bird` and `Fish` with concrete implementations of `move()`.**

42. **Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Implement `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes that provide the actual implementation of the `area()` method.**

43. **Define an abstract class `Appliance` with abstract methods `turn_on()` and `turn_off()`. Create `WashingMachine` and `Refrigerator` classes that implement these methods.**

44. **Create an abstract class `Vehicle` with an abstract method `drive()`. Implement `Car` and `Bike` classes that provide their own versions of the `drive()` method.**

45. **Write a Python program that uses an abstract base class `Media` with abstract methods `play()` and `stop()`. Create `Music` and `Video` classes that implement these methods.**

### Miscellaneous OOP Concepts:

46. **Write a Python program to demonstrate the difference between class methods and static methods in a `Company` class.**

47. **Implement a Python program that uses the `@property` decorator to define a class `Employee` with a computed property `salary_with_bonus`.**

48. **Write a Python program that demonstrates composition by creating a class `Engine` and embedding it inside a class `Car`.**

49. **Create a program that uses a mixin class `Loggable` to add logging functionality to any class by defining a `log()` method.**

50. **Write a Python program that demonstrates the concept of a `singleton` class where only one instance of the class can be created.**

These questions are designed to test various aspects of OOP in Python, including class design, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, method overloading/overriding, and abstract classes/interfaces.
