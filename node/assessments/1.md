Here are 12 easy-level interview questions for Node.js and MongoDB, along with explanations where relevant:

### Node.js Questions
V
1. **What is Node.js, and what are its main uses?**
   - *Expected Answer:* Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side. It’s commonly used for building server-side applications, RESTful APIs, real-time applications, and more.

2. **Explain the concept of an event loop in Node.js.**
   - *Expected Answer:* The event loop is a core feature of Node.js that allows non-blocking, asynchronous operations by handling callbacks and delegating tasks to the operating system, ensuring Node.js is highly efficient with I/O operations.

3. **What are callbacks, and how do they work in Node.js?**
   - *Expected Answer:* A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are commonly used in Node.js to handle asynchronous operations.

4. **What is npm, and how is it used in Node.js?**
   - *Expected Answer:* npm stands for Node Package Manager. It’s used to install, manage, and publish JavaScript packages or libraries that can be used in Node.js projects.

5. **How can you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?**
   - *Expected Answer:* You can create an HTTP server using the built-in `http` module. Example:
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');
     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.end('Hello, world!');
     });
     server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
     ```

6. **What is middleware in Express.js, and why is it useful?**
   - *Expected Answer:* Middleware in Express.js is a function that executes during the lifecycle of a request to the server. It has access to the request and response objects and can either end the request or pass it on to the next middleware. Middleware is useful for logging, handling errors, parsing data, etc.

7. **What are some common built-in modules in Node.js?**
   - *Expected Answer:* Common modules include `fs` (File System), `http` (for creating servers), `path` (file path utilities), `os` (operating system utilities), and `events` (event-driven programming).

### MongoDB Questions

8. **What is MongoDB, and how does it differ from traditional SQL databases?**
   - *Expected Answer:* MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of tables. Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB doesn’t require a predefined schema, allowing it to handle unstructured or semi-structured data more easily.

9. **What is a document in MongoDB, and how is it structured?**
   - *Expected Answer:* A document in MongoDB is the basic unit of data, stored as BSON (Binary JSON). Each document resembles a JSON object with key-value pairs, e.g., `{ "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }`.

10. **Explain the concept of a collection in MongoDB.**
    - *Expected Answer:* A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in SQL databases. Each collection can contain multiple documents, and the structure of documents within a collection can vary.

11. **How do you insert a document into a MongoDB collection?**
    - *Expected Answer:* You can use the `insertOne` or `insertMany` methods. Example:
      ```javascript
      db.collection('users').insertOne({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 });
      ```

12. **What command would you use to find all documents in a MongoDB collection?**
    - *Expected Answer:* You can use the `find` method to retrieve all documents. Example:
      ```javascript
      db.collection('users').find();
      ```
